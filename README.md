# SQL HR Analysis Project

## Overview
The SQL HR Analysis project is designed to explore and analyze an HR database through a series of SQL queries that answer critical HR-related questions. This project demonstrates proficiency in data manipulation, complex joins, window functions, common table expressions (CTEs), and overall database design principles.

## Key Questions Addressed
This project answers several important queries that provide insights into employee and project management within the organization:

1. **Longest Ongoing Project in Each Department**: Identify the project with the longest duration for every department.
2. **Non-Manager Employees**: Retrieve a list of all employees who do not hold managerial positions.
3. **Employees Hired After Project Start**: Find employees who were hired after the commencement of a project within their respective departments.
4. **Employee Ranking by Hire Date**: Rank employees within each department based on their hire date, with the earliest hire receiving the highest rank.
5. **Duration Between Employee Hires**: Calculate the duration between the hire date of each employee and the hire date of the subsequent employee hired in the same department.

## Skills Demonstrated
This project showcases a variety of SQL skills, including:

- **Data Manipulation**: Proficient use of SELECT, INSERT, CREATE, and UPDATE statements to manage and analyze data effectively.
- **Complex Joins**: Utilization of inner joins to combine data from multiple tables for comprehensive analysis.
- **Window Functions**: Application of advanced SQL techniques such as ROW_NUMBER, LEAD, PARTITION BY, and ORDER BY to perform complex calculations and rankings.
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Implementation of CTEs to simplify complex queries and enhance readability.
- **Database Design**: Knowledge of normalization, table creation, and relationship management to ensure efficient data organization and integrity.

## Conclusion
The SQL HR Analysis project not only answers pivotal HR questions but also serves as a practical demonstration of advanced SQL techniques and best practices in database management. This repository aims to provide valuable insights into HR analytics while showcasing the importance of data-driven decision-making in human resource management.
